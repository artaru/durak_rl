# Durak AI – Reinforcement Learning Agents
This project explores training reinforcement learning agents to play the Russian card game Durak. Using an PPO Actor-Critic framework, agents are trained through self-play and evaluated to measure relative skill progression. The project also includes an interactive mode where humans can play directly against trained AI models.
## Features
* Durak Environment – Custom game environment with rules, actions, and strategy dynamics.
* Actor-Critic Training – Self-play reinforcement learning with policy and value updates.
* Elo Evaluation – Models compared head-to-head with Elo scoring to track progression.
* Human vs AI – Play interactively against trained agents for qualitative evaluation.
